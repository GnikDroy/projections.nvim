                                                       *projections-Workspace*

Workspace                              A workspace is a directory that contains
                                       projects as their children. That’s it.
                                       Grandchildren are not considered
                                       projects.



  In the figure above, `W` is a workspace


                                                         *projections-Project*

Project                                A project is any subdirectory of a
                                       workspace which contains a
                                       file/directory present in `patterns`.


For instance, if `patterns` is `{ ".git", ".svn", ".hg" }`, then all Git, SVN,
and Mercurial repositories under workspace `W` are considered projects.


  In the figure above, `A`, and `B` are projects. `D` and `E` are **not**
  projects.


You can get creative with this, `{ "package.json" }`, would classify all `npm`
packages as projects.

_See `projections.init.setup`, or the next section for more details on
`patterns`_

                                                        *projections-Sessions*

Sessions                               This plugin also provides a small, and
                                       (completely optional) session manager
                                       for projects. **It is only intended to
                                       work with projections’ projects!**.
                                       See, `:h session` and
                                       `projections.session`


🔌 INSTALLATION                              *projections-🔌-installation*

**The table provided to setup consists of default values for the options.**
_None_ of the arguments are required. Workspaces can be configured dynamically
via a json file. See `AddWorkspace` command configuration below.

>
    use({ 
        'gnikdroy/projections.nvim',
        config = function()
            require("projections").setup({
                workspaces = {                                -- Default workspaces to search for 
                    -- { "~/Documents/dev", { ".git" } },        Documents/dev is a workspace. patterns = { ".git" }
                    -- { "~/repos", {} },                        An empty pattern list indicates that all subdirectories are considered projects
                    -- "~/dev",                                  dev is a workspace. default patterns is used (specified below)
                },
                -- patterns = { ".git", ".svn", ".hg" },      -- Default patterns to use if none were specified. These are NOT regexps.
                -- store_hooks = { pre = nil, post = nil },   -- pre and post hooks for store_session, callable | nil
                -- restore_hooks = { pre = nil, post = nil }, -- pre and post hooks for restore_session, callable | nil
                -- workspaces_file = "path/to/file",          -- Path to workspaces json file
                -- sessions_directory = "path/to/dir",        -- Directory where sessions are stored
            })
        end

🛠️ CONFIGURATION                      *projections-🛠️-configuration*

`projections` doesn’t register commands or keybindings. It leaves you with
100% control. As this might be inconvenient to some, this section comes with a
recommended configuration and recipes for different workflows.

RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION ~

The recommended setup does the following:


- Provides a telescope switcher for projects, which can be launched by `<leader>fp`
- Saves project’s session automatically on `VimExit`
- Switch to project if nvim was started from a project root


>
    use({
        "gnikdroy/projections.nvim",
        config = function()
            require("projections").setup({})
    
            -- Bind <leader>fp to Telescope projections
            require('telescope').load_extension('projections')
            vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>fp", function() vim.cmd("Telescope projections") end)
    
            -- Autostore session on VimExit
            local Session = require("projections.session")
            vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ 'VimLeavePre' }, {
                callback = function() Session.store(vim.loop.cwd()) end,
            })
    
            -- Switch to project if vim was started in a project dir
            local switcher = require("projections.switcher")
            vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "VimEnter" }, {
                callback = function()
                    if vim.fn.argc() == 0 then switcher.switch(vim.loop.cwd()) end
                end,
            })
        end
    })
<


Additionally you will likely want to enable `localoptions`:

>
    vim.opt.sessionoptions:append("localoptions")       -- Save localoptions to session file
<


RECIPES ~

                              *projections-Automatically-restore-last-session*

Automatically restore last session     The following lines setup an autocmd to
                                       automatically restore last session. If
                                       you are using the recommended
                                       configuration, make sure to remove the
                                       `VimEnter` autocmd


>
    -- If vim was started with arguments, do nothing
    -- If in some project's root, attempt to restore that project's session
    -- If not, restore last session
    -- If no sessions, do nothing
    local Session = require("projections.session")
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "VimEnter" }, {
        callback = function()
            if vim.fn.argc() ~= 0 then return end
            local session_info = Session.info(vim.loop.cwd())
            if session_info == nil then
                Session.restore_latest()
            else
                Session.restore(vim.loop.cwd())
            end
        end,
        desc = "Restore last session automatically"
    })
<


                                         *projections-Manual-Session-commands*

Manual Session commands                The following lines register two
                                       commands `StoreProjectSession` and
                                       `RestoreProjectSession`. Both of them
                                       attempt to store/restore the session if
                                       `cwd` is a project directory.


>
    local Session = require("projections.session")
    vim.api.nvim_create_user_command("StoreProjectSession", function()
        Session.store(vim.loop.cwd())
    end, {})
    
    vim.api.nvim_create_user_command("RestoreProjectSession", function()
        Session.restore(vim.loop.cwd())
    end, {})
<


                                     *projections-Create-AddWorkspace-command*

Create AddWorkspace command            The following example creates a
                                       `AddWorkspace` user command which adds
                                       the current directory to workspaces json
                                       file. Default set of `patterns` is used.


>
    local Workspace = require("projections.workspace")
    -- Add workspace command
    vim.api.nvim_create_user_command("AddWorkspace", function() 
        Workspace.add(vim.loop.cwd()) 
    end, {})
<


INTENDED USAGE ~


  You are responsible for creating a clear folder structure for your projects!
  While this plugin doesn’t force any particularly outrageous folder structure,
  it won’t work well with a particularly outrageous folder structure either!


`projections` stores information in the following places by default:

>
    workspaces = stdpath('data') .. 'projections_workspaces.json'
    sessions   = stdpath('cache') .. 'projections_sessions/'
<


🔭 ABOUT TELESCOPE                        *projections-🔭-about-telescope*

**The telescope plugin is intended to be the primary method to switch between
projects!** So expect the usability of this plugin to be greatly compromised if
you don’t use telescope.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>

That being said, you can create your own project switcher with the exposed
functions.

🔍 USE FZF? ~

Take a look at the unofficial extension by nyngwang: fzf-lua-projections
<https://github.com/nyngwang/fzf-lua-projections.nvim>

💻 API                                                *projections-💻-api*

The source files are documented for now. But this section will be completed in
due time. The API is not stable. You might need to spend a couple of minutes
every once in a while to update! That being said, most of the core stuff
shouldn’t change.

📦 INTERACTION WITH PLUGINS      *projections-📦-interaction-with-plugins*

Neovim’s sessions do not work well with some plugins. For example, if you try
`:mksession` with an open `nvim-tree` window, it will store instructions for an
empty buffer in the sessions file.

There are several other plugins that do not work well. There are several
methods to deal with this including:


1. Close all such buffers before saving the session. `see pre store hooks`
2. Store all such buffers, and then restore them accordingly. `see post restore hooks`
3. Do nothing and handle the buffers manually, either at store or restore.


For example, let’s see how you can close `nvim-tree`, or `neo-tree` before
storing sessions:

>
    require("projections").setup({
        store_hooks = {
            pre = function()
                -- nvim-tree 
                local nvim_tree_present, api = pcall(require, "nvim-tree.api")
                if nvim_tree_present then api.tree.close() end
    
                -- neo-tree
                if pcall(require, "neo-tree") then vim.cmd [[Neotree action=close]] end
            end
        }
    })
<


**Will such a functionality be present in `projections`?** Hard to say. This is
not an easy problem to solve reliably. Option 2 sounds reasonable, but everyone
has different needs. And since the user knows better than `projections`, I am
inclined to push this responsibility to the user as well. If enough people ask
for this, I may provide support for common plugins via something like
`projections.unstable`
